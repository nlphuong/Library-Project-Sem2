                    <p>The library is an ideal place to enjoy the delight of perusing and for exploring. And let Memorial give you all you need. We inspire and enable independent minds, providing resources, spaces and technologies. A library, which may vary widely in size, may be organized for use and maintained by a public body such as a government, an institution/ schools, a corporation, or a private individual. In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are trained and experts at finding, selecting, circulating and organizing information and at interpreting information needs, navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of resources. Hence, librarians go an extra mile to meet the user's need by ensuring that their users are satisfied with the information provided.[citation needed] A Librarian is one person who is expected to be very vibrant and innovative especially in this digital world.</p>
